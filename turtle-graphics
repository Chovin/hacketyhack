Turtle Graphics support (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)

Turtle code can be run from the HacketyHack editor, two modes are available:

1. interactive mode, allowing step by step execution

Turtle.start do
  # turtle code here
end


2. drawing mode that execute the whole code at once

Turtle.draw do
  # turtle code here
end


== Available Commands ==
penup
after this command gets called the pen is up and nothing is drawn

pendown
after this command the pen is dawn and lines are drawn as the turtle moves

pendown?
returns true if the pen is down, (default is true)

pensize x
set the width of the line drawn by the turtle to x

pencolor c
set the color of the line drawn by the turtle to c, use the shoes color system

background c
set the background color to c, use the shoes color system

forward x
moves the turtle forward by x pixels
when no options are given a default argument of 50 pixels is used

backward x
moves the turtle forward by x pixels, equivalent to forward -x
when no options are given a default argument of 50 pixels is used

turnleft a
turns the turtle heading a degrees to the left, default heading is 0 degrees
when no options are given a default argument of 90 degrees is used

turnright a
turns the turtle heading a degrees to the right, equivalent to turnleft -a
when no options are given a default argument of 90 degrees is used

setheading a
sets the current heading to a

getheading
retuns the current heading in degrees

setx x
moves the turtle horizontally to (current_y, x)
doesn't draw anything

sety y
moves the turtle vertically to (y, current_x)
doesn't draw anything

goto x, y
moves the turtle to (x, y)
doesn't draw anything

getposition
retuns [x, y] (as an array)

clear
removes all content (but does not change the turtle attributes)

reset
removes all content and resets all attributes (including turtle position)



== Example ==


Turtle.start do
  background blue
  pensize 2
  pencolor yellow
  30.times do
    goto rand(width), rand(height)
    setheading rand(360)
    len = 5 + rand(30)
    5.times do
      forward len
      turnleft 180-360/10
    end
  end
end
