Hackety Hack
============

* Go through the whole thing
* Look for issues
* Log them
* See if can fix any of them
* Play with shoes

Hackety Hack Problems:

* Mac
  
* Windows
  - when hover over the x button in the sidebar, the word "Close" is cut off
  - when enter text wherever, pipe symbols follow the cursor
    - actually, it seems like it is ghosting the text
* Linux
* All
  - lesson 1.13 Counting
    - the example here is a little dumb
      - "your name has #{x} letters"
  - lesson 2.2, 2.3 etc.
    - saving the files to .hacketyhack sucks on a mac
      - how does a newbie find that?
    - I understand you are trying to show the kids how that works, but maybe that's a different thing?
    - maybe ask_save_file is the thing to do here
  - some kind of weird highlighting/select that I can't get rid of


* Shoes

Hackety Hack Suggestions:
-------------------------

* Can the displayed program not go over the black area, so you can read the lesson as the program runs?

* Can we copy from the lesson?  eg. 2.3 Running the Program, being able to copy the url would be nice.
