h1. Hackety Hack
for Mac OS X, Windows XP/Vista, and Linux

 Hackety Hack is a programming starter kit. It's an editor
 with helpful coding tools and built-in messaging (so you can
 pass scripts to friends easily.)

h2. Oh So Fashionable Beta

 Hackety Hack is not quite ready yet. Lots of things aren't quite working, 
 but we're trying. Rome wasn't built in a day...

 We have a "Lighthouse":http://hacketyhack.lighthouseapp.com/ account. We'd love
 to get some bug reports.

h2. Building Hackety Hack

 If you are an advanced user (familiar with C and Ruby,) you
 may enjoy helping out with H-ety H.

 With Shoes installed, you can checkout the source code and
 start things up like so:

bq.   $ git clone git://github.com/steveklabnik/hacketyhack.git 
   $ cd hacketyhack
   $ shoes h-ety-h.rb

 If you need to install Shoes, just run this first:

bq.   $ git clone git://github.com/whymirror/shoes.git
   $ cd shoes
   $ rake

 Shoes will be built and put in the dist directory.

 If you want to build Hackety Hack as a standalone app
 with the installer for your platform:

bq.   $ git clone git://github.com/steveklabnik/hacketyhack.git 
   $ git clone git://github.com/whymirror/shoes.git 
   $ cd shoes
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack VIDEO=1
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack installer

 There is no installer for Linux, bear in mind.

 Beneath my wings are many winds.

* _why, who was quite the lucky stiff. Without his work and
    vision, Hackety Hack would have never been born. Hopefully
    he'll be proud of how his child lives out its life...
 
* Yukihiro Matsumoto, whose Ruby language
    is the heart of Hackety Hack. I adore
    this language. Ruby's shared lib and stdlib
    are included under the terms of the Ruby
    license.

* Sharon Rosner for the Sequel lib
    (http://sequel.rubyforge.org)
    I use a fork from an old version.

* Jamis Buck for the Syntax lib.

    Live syntax highlighting.

* Alex Brem for help on bloopsaphone.
    He just started hacking away. I like that!

* Numerous font authors whose free
    offerings are included. I need to
    assemble a list...
